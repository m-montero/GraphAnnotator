## Annotate Layers

One of the key ideas behind `ggplot2` is to build complex graphs --- one layer at a time. Thus, if your graph has two annotation layers, the first layer is applied then the second will be on applied on top of it. 

Use the `+ Add Layer` and `- Remove Layer` buttons below to interactively **add and customize** annotations layers and **remove** them, respectively. 

For a given annotation layer, you can start annotating your graph by selecting an annotation type. Based on the select type, configure your annotation using the populated widgets. To simplify annotation placement, enable the “Read mouse” and begin hovering the graph. “Click” once you have moved your annotation to the desired location.
